#Bash-code (Linux terminal) to use FORCE software 

#Finding 2021 imagery for my analysis:



force-level1-csd -n -c 0,50 -d 20210315,20211115 -s S2A,S2B {your directory}/metadata_catalogue {your directory}/2021/level-1-datapool {your directory}/2021/queue.txt {your directory}/shapefiles/tile_list_deu3.csv



#With this code you can run FORCE with the selected parameters. Here is what they mean:

force-level1-csd 
#calls the submodule from FORCE. Of course, FORCE needs to be installed on your system.

-n 
#indicates that you do not want to actually download the data just yet. Once you found which data you want to download, remove the "-n".

-c 0,50 
#indicates that you want to find imagery that has a cloud coverage of 0 to 50%. 
#Any tile of satellite imagery with more than 50% cloud coverage will not be found (even if it contains 50% perfectly useful data).

-d 20210315,20211115 
#indicates that you want to find imagery within the timeframe of 15th March 2021 and 15th November 2021.
#My analysis would always use imagery within this timeframe for each year. So for e.g. 2020 it would be "-d 20200315,20201115" instead.

-s S2A,S2B 
#indicates that you want only imagery from the Sentinel-2 missions. FORCE level-1 may also download Landsat data, but we ommitted that here.

#For the following be advised: {your directory} refers to whichever path you set as the path where FORCE data will be stored. 
#On a regular Linux system it could be anything like /home/john/FORCE/..... You decide. 
#What comes after {your directory} is my advised path structure, but you may as well adjust it to your personal preferences.

{your directory}/metadata_catalogue 
#points the FORCE module to where the metadata catalogue with Sentinel-2 metadata (and maybe Landsat-data) is located.
#This catalogue must have been set-up during the installation of FORCE. If you don't have it, refer back to the FORCE documentation.

{your directory}/2021/level-1-datapool 
#points to where the data requested will be downloaded to. If you have "-n" in the command as above, FORCE will not 
#download anything there. Regardless, the folder has to exist, so make sure you created it beforehand. 
#Once you remove the "-n", data will be downloaded into this folder.

{your directory}/2021/queue.txt 
#points to the file queue, where all downloaded satellite imagery tiles' names will be stored for later use in FORCE Level 2.
#Same as above, with "-n" in place, nothing will be written to queue.txt, but the file has to exist, so make sure you create an empty queue.txt first.

{your directory}/shapefiles/tile_list.csv 
#points to a file that contains a list of the tile names in the internal format of the Sentinel-2 mission. If you want to download data for just one or
#two tiles, you may as well just write them out instead of pointing to a file. "T33UUU,T33UVU" for example would get you imagery of 
#the greater Berlin region. I created a list of 29 tiles which cover 96% of Germany. You can find this "tile_list.csv" in this repository.
